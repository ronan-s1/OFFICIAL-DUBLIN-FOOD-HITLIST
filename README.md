## THE LIST <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

### OH!MY STREET FOOD (7/10)
Xian burger is pretty good, over priced now. Spice bags are very nice too but just not worth the price anymore.

<hr>

### Wing's World Cuisine (6.2/10)
Decent buffet in the city center. Dinner is better than lunch, more variety and seems fresher. Hashbrowns are very succulent.

<hr>

### Charlies 3 (7.8/10)
Decent spice bag.

<hr>

### Fasta (6/10)
Kinda mid, venue is nice though. Just found out this place is permanently closed rip.

<hr>

### Star Pizza (8/10)
Nice little pizza and burger place in on talbot street. All day special goes hard, worth the price. 

<hr>

### Gala (deprecated üò¢) (8/10)
‚Ç¨2.50 mini spice box slapped. It is now unfortunately ‚Ç¨3 something, honestly very upsetting.

<hr>

### Wok on Inn (7/10)
Very nice spicy box, big portion. However do NOT get it past like 10pm, they just chuck random stuff in there and for this reason they have gotten a lower score.

<hr>

### Xian Street Food (7.2/10)
Staple place for a spice bag, some may say the best place for a spicy bag. Portions are good, sometimes a bit too salty though so maybe ask for less salt.

<hr>

### Krewe (7.4/10)
Decent

<hr>

### Tesco ‚Ç¨1 Denny's Hot To Go meals (deprecated üò¢) (8.2/10)
This one really breaks my heart. This use to be such a go to until they raised their prices. I don't really blame them honestly it was too good to be true, good while it lasted.

<hr>

### Pasaeno (7/10)
Cheap food, not bad.

<hr>

### Mad Egg (8.3/10)
Very nice place if you like chicken burgers. The goat burger is the best in my opinion. Cheesecakes there are also very good.

<hr>

### Gaucho's Dog (8.73/10)
Very good place, unfortunately they closed the one on tara street.

<hr>

### Arisu (7.7/10)
Nice Korean food, big portions, bit pricey.

<hr>

### Pizza Max (3/10)
So bad, doesn't deserve to be here.

<hr>

very good place, nice milkshakes.

<hr>

Good

<hr>

Good

<hr>

### Zaytoon (8/10)
Nice place, nice venue, good food overall.

<hr>

### Hot Chix by Ruby's (8.75/10)
very nice place, burgers are good and on Wednesdays its half price on food. Cheesecake is also good but isn't really a cheesecake.

<hr>

### Takara ramen & deli sushi bar (7/10)
Honestly? Overrated. Food is good and place looks nice but I don't get why there's always a queue outside the place.

<hr>

### White Rabbit (7.66/10)
Nice food, good for corn dogs. However there's like barely anywhere to sit/

<hr>

### Roseland Chinese (6.9/10)
Big spice bag for the price and it's pretty good. Cash only though!

<hr>

### Hannah BBQ (7.5/10)
Kebabs and wraps kinda place, basically a less boujee Zaytoon. The kebab is quite good and baklava was quite nice too. It's worth the price I would say if you're feeling a doner kebab and in the area.
