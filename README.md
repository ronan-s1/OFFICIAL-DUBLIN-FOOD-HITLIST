# LIST

### OH!MY STREET FOOD (7/10)
Xian burger pretty good, over priced now. Spice bags are very nice too but just not worth price anymore.

<hr>

### Wing's World Cuisine (7/10)
Hashbrowns are good.

<hr>

### Charlies (7.8/10)
Decent spice bag.

<hr>

### Fasta (6/10)
Kinda mid, venue is nice though.

<hr>

### Star Pizza (8/10)
All day special goes hard, worth the price. 

<hr>

### Gala (deprecated üò¢) (8/10)
‚Ç¨2.50 mini spice box slapped. It is now unfortunately ‚Ç¨3 something, honestly very upsetting.

<hr>

### Wok on Inn (7/10)
Very nice spicy box, big portion. However do NOT get it past like 10pm, they just chuck random stuff in there and for this reason they have gotten a lower score.

<hr>

### Xian (7.2/10)
Staple place for a spice bag, some may say the best place for a spicy bag. Portions are good, sometimes a bit too salty though so maybe ask for less salt.

<hr>

### Krewe (7.4/10)
Decent

<hr>

### Tesco ‚Ç¨1 Denny's Hot To Go meals (deprecated üò¢) (8.2/10)
This one really breaks my heart. This use to be such a go to until they raised their prices. I don't really blame them honestly it was too good to be true, good while it lasted.

<hr>

### Pasaeno (7/10)
Cheap food, not bad.

<hr>

### Mad Egg (8.3/10)
